```python
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QPushButton, QVBoxLayout, QWidget, QLabel
import requests

class TemuDesktopApp(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle("Temu Desktop Clone")
        self.setGeometry(100, 100, 800, 600)

        # Layout
        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        self.product_label = QLabel("Loading products...")
        layout.addWidget(self.product_label)
        fetch_button = QPushButton("Fetch Products")
        fetch_button.clicked.connect(self.fetch_products)
        layout.addWidget(fetch_button)

        container = QWidget()
        container.setLayout(layout)
        self.setCentralWidget(container)

    def fetch_products(self):
        response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/products")
        if response.status_code == 200:
            products = response.json()
            self.product_label.setText("\n".join([p["name"] for p in products]))
        else:
            self.product_label.setText("Error fetching products")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = TemuDesktopApp()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```
- Backend API (e.g., FastAPI) would serve `/products` with sample data.

#### 7. Considerations
- **Performance:** Optimize for desktop by caching data locally.
- **Security:** Use HTTPS for APIs and OAuth for user authentication.
- **Scalability:** Design backend to handle multiple users with load balancing if needed.
